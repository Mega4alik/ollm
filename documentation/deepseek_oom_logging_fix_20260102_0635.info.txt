Summary of Changes:
Resolved OOM (Out Of Memory) errors and logging visibility issues in the DeepSeek workflow.

Detailed Implementation Notes:
1. **Fix OOM in `src/ollm/kvcache.py`:**
   - Corrected the `KVCache` class to clear `self.key_cache` and `self.value_cache` (standard `DynamicCache` attributes) instead of the non-existent `self.layers` attribute. This ensures that memory used by the cache is properly released after being saved to disk/processed, preventing unlimited growth in VRAM.

2. **Fix Logging in `src/ollm/deepseek.py`:**
   - Added `stats.print_and_clean()` to `MyDeepseekModel.forward`. This restores the standard output logs (e.g., `./Deepseek.forward...`) that were previously missing, allowing the user to track progress.

3. **Verify `kvikio`:**
   - Added explicit logging in `src/ollm/gds_loader.py` to print "kvikio is available and imported" if the module is successfully loaded.

4. **Refine Offloading Logic:**
   - Updated `offload_layers_to_cpu` in `deepseek.py` to use `loader.offloaded_map.clear()` instead of iterating and deleting. This is a safer and more robust way to enforce the "skip CPU RAM" optimization for GDS.

Fixes & Caveats:
- Fix: OOM crash resolved by fixing memory clearing logic in `KVCache`.
- Fix: Logs now appear in standard output.
- Verification: `kvikio` status is explicitly printed on startup.

Usage Instructions:
No changes to usage. Run the example script as before:
```bash
python3 scripts/example_deepseek_moe.py
```

Technical Metrics:
- Confirmed `KVCache` now interacts with the correct underlying storage list (`key_cache`).
- Confirmed logging logic is present in the main forward loop.
