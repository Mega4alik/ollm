Summary of Changes:
Added debugging and fallback logic to `src/ollm/kvcache.py` to address the `AttributeError: 'KVCache' object has no attribute 'key_cache'`.

Detailed Implementation Notes:
1. **Debug Logging:**
   - Added a check `if not hasattr(self, "key_cache"):`.
   - If true, prints `DEBUG: KVCache missing key_cache. Attributes: {dir(self)}` to standard output. This will allow identification of the correct storage attribute used by the installed version of `transformers.DynamicCache`.

2. **Conditional Clearing:**
   - Changed the memory clearing logic to be conditional:
     - If `key_cache` exists, clear `self.key_cache[layer_idx]`.
     - Else if `layers` exists (legacy fallback), clear `self.layers[layer_idx].keys/values`.
   - This prevents the script from crashing due to the missing attribute, while still attempting to prevent OOM if a known attribute is found.

Fixes & Caveats:
- Fix: Prevents immediate crash on `AttributeError`.
- Caveat: If neither `key_cache` nor `layers` contains the actual high-memory tensors, OOM may still occur eventually. The debug log is needed to confirm the correct target.

Usage Instructions:
No changes to usage. Run the example script as before:
```bash
python3 scripts/example_deepseek_moe.py
```

Technical Metrics:
- Confirmed syntax validity of the patch.
